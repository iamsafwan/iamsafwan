- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to break things to make new things. I have written more than 2000 lines of code in C# and then learned the basics of the language. 😂🤣🤣
                Programming is similar to driving a car 🚙, if you know the fundamental and concepts, the syntax isn't a problem. 
                Also, I enjoy driving. 🚘❤️🤩🤣🤣
