### Hi there,

- 🔭 I’m an IoT Engineer, recently graduated from the Queen Mary University of London.
- 🌱 You can always find me behind computer coding or learning about recent technology.
      At the moment, I am learning about Microsoft Azure, Github, and Exercising my skills in Full-Stack IoT. 
      and working on:
     - [Project-Alpha](https://github.com/iamsafwan/project-alpha), is a UWP based password manager.
     - [Project-Dashboard](https://github.com/iamsafwan/project-dashboard), is a REST API based platform to retrieve interests from external services and serve over HTML.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to break things to make new things. I have written more than 2000 lines of code in C# and then learned the basics of the language. 
                Programming is similar to driving a car 🚙, if you know the fundamental and concepts, the syntax isn't a problem. 
                Also, I enjoy driving. 🚘❤️🤩
